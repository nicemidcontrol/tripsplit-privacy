# Privacy Policy — TripSplit

**Last updated:** February 23, 2026

TripSplit ("the App") helps users split group expenses and view settlement summaries. This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected, how it is used, and the choices available to you.

## 1) Information We Collect

### 1.1 Data you create in the app (stored on your device)
The App stores trip and expense data locally on your device (on-device storage). We do not require account registration.

### 1.2 Data collected automatically (third-party services)
The App uses third-party services for analytics and advertising. These services may automatically collect:
- Device identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID / app instance identifiers)
- IP address (may be used to estimate general location)
- App activity and interaction data (e.g., app launches, taps, ad interactions)
- Diagnostics and performance data (e.g., crash/performance signals)

## 2) How We Use Information
We use information to:
- Provide and improve app functionality
- Understand app usage and improve user experience (analytics)
- Show ads and prevent fraud/abuse (advertising)

## 3) Sharing of Information
We may share information with third-party service providers that help operate the App, including:
- Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) for advertising
- Firebase Analytics for analytics and measurement

These providers process data according to their own policies.

## 4) Sharing Features (User-Initiated)
If you choose to share a summary using your device's share feature (e.g., messaging or email apps), the content is sent to the app/service you select. We do not receive this shared content.

## 5) Data Retention
Trip and expense data remains on your device unless you delete it in the app or uninstall the app. Automatically collected analytics/ads data is retained as determined by the third-party providers.

## 6) Security
We take reasonable measures to protect information. Data transmitted by third-party SDKs may be encrypted in transit (e.g., via HTTPS/TLS).

## 7) Children's Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 8) Your Choices
- You can reset or limit your Android Advertising ID in device settings.
- You can stop data collection by uninstalling the App.

## 9) Changes to this Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date will be revised accordingly.
